RAK App - React Native app
===

This is an RAK  [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app for the online banking with graphQL database dataset with  [Hasura](https://hasura.io/).

## Setup

git clone https://github.com/subhashraj1413/RAKApp.git


## Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### `yarn install`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

#### iOS
####  `# cd ios && pod install`
####  `# yarn ios`
#### Android
#### `cd android`
####  `# yarn android`
